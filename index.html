      <p class="text-muted">Queensbury was the second grant-maintained school. The school had been flagged
         for closure but the community, including the local Member of Parliament,
         David Madel, fought to keep it open and took advantage of the introduction of the grant-maintained system introduced in 1988. Grant-maintained
       schools were abolished in 1998, and Queensbury was converted
        to a foundation school. During its ten years as a grant-maintained school,
         it grew from having very low enrolment numbers (as the school was due to close) to being heavily
          oversubscribed.</p>

     <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was built in 1972</h5>
     <p>Because the school used to be two separate schools, the buildings are quite a distant apart and there is some duplication in rooms across the school.
        There are, for instance, two gyms, main halls and canteens. There are two entrances from different sides of the site,
         although the main entrance leading to reception in the Central building is on Langdale Road.This makes it have more playground space and a bigger width.</p>
